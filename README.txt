Hey guys there is nothing much to read here, but essentially what the menu plugin does
is when the player does /menu. The console does /sudo player name shop shoppagename.
So that means you will need the following plugins.

1.) Essentials (for /sudo)
2.) Shop (To Open and Create a shop page)

There are many things to improve of this plugin. In the future we hope to create a built in page builder and potentially 
negate the need of essentials and shop plugin.
